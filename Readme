# Project Title

Week 3 Assignment: Random Password Generator

## Description
The purpose of this READme is to provide a detailed description of this site.

The site allows users to generate a random password. The user can choose anywhere between 8 and 128 characts to form the password. The user can also choose to include at least 1 or as many variables that include upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.

After making the selection the user will be presented with their random password.

The site can be accessed via this link:
https://tjsoho.github.io/w3-password-generator/

### This repository contains:
* A READme file detailing the assignment and the site
* Html.index file
* Script.JS
* Assets folder that contains the following:
* Png file of the site
* Css folder containing css style sheet
* Original ReadMe

The site had some starter code and I have gone through and added the function to generate the password.

I have also notated within the code to break down the various sections and to also use as a reference point for myself when developing further APIs.

Below is a screenshot of what the site looks like.
